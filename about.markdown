Hello, World! My name is Cliff and *Notes of Cliff* is my blog.

I have been a developer for about 15 years and a Free Software advocate for much longer.

I have specialized in backend development, system administration, automation and much more.

Some technology that I enjoy:

* Python
* Django
* Pandas
* XSLT
* GatewayScript
* Splunk
* Ansible
* APIConnect
* Linux (I prefer the RHEL family of distos)

Please stay tuned for future posts and projects.
